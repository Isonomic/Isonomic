					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p class="first">Isanom is a user owned social media platform. 100% of the net profit goes back into our pockets and into our data centers and infrastructure which are owned and divided equally by anyone with an active account. You can choose to be actively involved in voting on operations and fund distribution, or you can delegate this power to someone of your choice and simply use the social platform with your friends or for your business like you are doing right now, only you will get paid every month for doing it. Why should anyone else get rich off of your online social engagement. Its your eyes that viewed the adds not anyone else's. This platform is designed to strengthen your mental and emotional health instead of deteriorate it like studies have now confirmed the current major social platforms do to us. All of your information is protected and owned by you, yet stored in the cloud for you combining ease of use, convenience and total protection over the data that is being exploited and used without our consent. To be involved, own the company and receive the first payment, leave your email <a href="https://isanom.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=57c316b7b3d1fc5230ce1a5b9&amp;id=d5b6cc8921">here</a> or send the best way to contact you the day of launch July 1 to <a href="mailto:we@isanom.com"> we@isanom.com.</a> You will receive one message only on that day. </p>

							<p> Last year the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/loose-lips-sink-apps/">largest social media</a>  company made 3 billion dollars in one month from the advertisements you were exposed to. From day one the eyes that viewed those adds should have received the money from them. Today they will. We alone own 100% of the company and get 100% of the donation and marketing revenues. We will hire our own team, build our own data centers and branch into other fields as needed. No one can  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17145200/brian-acton-delete-facebook-whatsapp">ever buy</a> any amount of this enterprise. There is no owner and no founder. you.....we are the CEO of isanom.  </p>

								<p>What is more valuable then our minds and our emotional well being? Studies have  <a href="https://ie.reachout.com/2017/11/30/social-media-and-suicide-rates/">now proven</a> that the social media today is programmed to make maximum revenues, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology">dopamine addict </a>us instantly, cause anxiety and depression, and have actually been directly linked to an increase in suicides among teenagers. If implemented properly, social media can actually be mentally and emotionally stimulating, uplifting and positive, but it needs to be designed correctly and for the <a href="https://om.co/2018/02/20/the-1-reason-facebook-wont-ever-change/"> right reasons. </a>up until now, we have not seen this. Isanom is designing the application to strengthen the mind, emotions and human connection while still being exciting to be on. On this platform you have a voice. If you want some new feature and 50.1% of people agree, it gets executed and implemented.</p>

								<h2 class="card-title">3.Voice/Vote</h2>
								<img src="isokid.jpg" alt="">
								<p> Recently, one social platform  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-funds-its-favorite-experts-but-skirts-tough-critics">paid </a>experts to say that their messenger app for 6 year olds was safe for their minds, another <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/snapchats-new-update-triggers-revolt-by-millions-of-teens">outraged</a> users by reinventing the layout for greater monetization, and another <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-used-private-location-data-for-party-amusement-1640820384">spied </a>on its users for amusement at a party. If the users of these platforms had an equal vote and 100% control, none of these things would have happened. Isanom will be using a <a href="https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f">"direct liquid democracy"</a> for all  decisions regarding how our funds will be used or any other major decision regarding our social app.

Data is valuable for a multitude of reasons today. From advertising to training artificial intelligence and more. As of right now, its not too late. Data is not like wine that gets better with age. You can't train self driving cars on paved roads using data collected from a horse and buggy on dirt. I will leave you with the words of Vladimir Putin regarding the need for massive data and artificial intelligence, "Whoever <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/04/ai-artificial-intelligence-putin-rule-world/">owns the artificial intelligence</a> will control the world."  I hope this has helped you see why this matters to you, myself and any living or yet to be born human being.</p>

								<p>You might be wondering why anyone would want to start a business that they will never own even 0.1% of and that gives all of the money back to the people who would normally be the companies source of income. All I can say is the definition of wealth means different things to different people. If you value the future state of humanity more then money in the bank, then Isanom is where you belong........wait a minute we all get paid too. Win win. The first round of voting to allocate and divide the money raised from the day we launch on, will be held on July 4 between anyone with their email or contact info registered. Here is how you can <a href="help.html">help.</a>   </p>
