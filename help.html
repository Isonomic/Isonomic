    <p>If you see the power in this enterprise and how it impacts you directly now and future generations after you, then there are a few things you can do to help push this movement forward. First of all, if you have not already registered, save the date July 1 in your calender as a reminder to visit this sight. On that day, anyone with an active account will automatically own the company divided by the other users who have registered. As well, anyone registered will automatically get the net profit raised by Isanom returned back to them simply for being on board. 
        
            <p>We have created an easy to remember slogan called the 4321 protocol to help spread the Isonomic vision around the globe and put the control of technology and wealth back into the hands of the people. It is as follows, learn the 4 main reasons why this matters so much. Prosperity, mental health, voice/vote and privacy, or PMVP for short (4 reasons in more detail below). Tell the 3 people that you care about the most and point them to this site. Point and tell 2 people whoes values are inline with yours and whoes vote you would like to have represent and impact your future. Tell 1 person who could use free money in their life or has not had a voice that has been heard in the past.</p>   
     <p>In order for this to succeed, we will need to get the message out. We are looking for any type of help. All people have different gifts and serve in a unique way so whatever you are good at we need it. Some possible open positions and ideas are as folows.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <u> Chief Executive Officer</u></li> <p> Not actually a CEO in the common sense as he serves and answers to the people. Think of this person as the one in charge of operations until the first vote.</p>
        <li> <u> Computer Hardware Architect</u></li> <p>  In charge of building our hardware and infrastructure needed to run our application and store our photos and posts etc. </p> 
        <li> <u> Lead Software Developer</u> <p>  Will build the open source social media web application.</p></li>
        <li> <u> Marketing/Fund raising Lead </u></li>

     All money raised through donation or advertising will be openly available for all to see and distributed via a 50 percent or greater vote and the code executing divided ownership will also be open source. It is the authors belief that we will operate similar to other successful social platforms that have gone before us which hire thousands of well paid employees and still make billions of dollars of profit. My point simply is, all the power rests in our hands alone. Equally and fairly with every voice/vote counting as 1. Hopefully you are starting to see the importance of sharing this platform with anyone who you feel would represent the future you would like to live in. In my opinion the social media companies today have more power then the government so this is a real opportunity for true direct liquid democracy to have a foothold in the future state of affairs. We are building power into the hands of the people from the ground up in the form of democratized enterprise beginning with the most obvious avenue of social media. We all get paid and equally own a tech company that you can considered a long term investment in your future.
